# Hi there, I'm Ishaan 👋

I'm a Salesforce Developer with 2.5+ years of experience working across Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, CPQ, and CRM automation projects in enterprise environments.

I specialize in building scalable Salesforce solutions using Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), Flows, and REST integrations. I’ve worked on case management systems, Omni-Channel routing, deployment automation (Copado, Git), and Agentforce-driven solutions.

I enjoy solving complex business problems through clean architecture, reusable logic, and secure integrations.
